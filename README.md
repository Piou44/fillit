# fillit

Fillit is a project allowing you to discover and / or familiarize yourself with a recurring problem in programming: the search for an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities, within a reasonable time. In the case of this project, it will be to arrange "Tetriminos" among themselves and to determine the smallest possible square that can accommodate them.
